# Lensa
Project started during HackPNW 2023. 

# Official Submission Description
## Inspiration
We took inspiration for Lensa from our own lives and our feelings of helplessness surrounding our schedule. Oftentimes, after a long, tiresome school day, we find ourselves yearning to hang out with friends, or even just sleep, but in doing so we unintentionally skip club meetings, sports practices, or study sessions for important exams. We’ve felt helpless and found ourselves on an endless hunt for a solution to break the disappointing pattern. Our search didn’t yield any results, so we decided to take matters into our own hands and start owning our schedule instead of allowing it to own us.

## What It Does
Calendar apps can be tedious, hard to access, and slow to load in the worst moments, like when someone’s asking you if you’re free after school. With Lensa’s flexible scheduling assistant, you can access your calendar from your text messaging app and easily make plans on the fly without having your spontaneous surprises conflict with your already set schedule. There are three main functionalities of the flexible scheduling aspect: adding events from a text message, sending automatic messages based on events happening on your calendar, and checking if any events conflict with each other. This is the aspect of Lensa we really honed in on developing these past few days.

## How We Built It
We built this demo using Python and the Twilio API.

## Challenges We Ran Into
We were very inexperienced with using APIs, so we had to learn a lot about using them effectively in Python.

## Accomplishments That We're Proud Of
This is our first hackathon! We’re very proud of our concept and the graphic design, and how much we’ve learned along the way.

## What We Learned
We learned how to use APIs, enhanced our graphic design skills, and got closer overall. 

## What's Next For Lensa
We want to finish off the other features outlined in the demo video, such as allowing users to seamlessly import all their calendars and to dos to the app, set preferences to fit individual needs/wants (with an anonymous heads up to event coordinators regarding accessibility needs), organize events into different categories based off different characteristics, and introduce a tailored _lensanalysis_ – percentage breakdown of categories of events of your calendar and where the majority of your events are.
